      "description": "With accuracy, you are able to determine the precision of your device location. The value for accuracy defines a radius, in which the retrieved location usually lays in. Therefore a higher value is more imprecise and potentially has the effect of degrading service quality, while improving your privacy."

      "description": "Using the interval you can determine, how often this app is able to retrieve a new location from your device. A higher value therefore leads to a less frequent retrieval of your devices location. Example: If you've set to 10 Minutes, this means a new location is at maximum retrieved every 10 Minutes. In the meantime the previously retrieved location is used, which of course it might up to 10 Minutes old, which could potentially degrade the service quality."
